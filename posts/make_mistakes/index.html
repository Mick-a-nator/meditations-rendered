	<section><p>When you are afraid of failure or making mistakes you become inactive, however the only true failure is never having started. You absorb yourself it what is &ldquo;best&rdquo;: Best practices, best frameworks, best theories. For all the research in the world, there will always be something you have missed, something unique to you and your situation. Your perfect plan will crumble and you will have to adapt.</p>
<p>And you will adapt, but at what cost? The only cost you have incurred is the time wasted perfecting a plan that was always going to require adjustment.</p>
<p>Instead, endeavor to make mistakes early and often. You will not make them deliberateliy, of course, but you will learn from all of them. Invest your time wisely in learning from as many mistakes as you can. This is how you grow. Learn as much as required to solve the problem at hand, implement the solution regardless of its perfection, then uncovorer the next.</p>
